# TODO

- [ ] Get saving to IndexedDb working - I have IndexedDB working, now I just
      need to be able to save the weeks choices. It would also be nice to be
      able to create new recipes also before the next step.
- [ ] Service worker
- [ ] Use service worker to sync to S3 with the AWS Lambda function
- [ ] Use Netlify's user/password to start working on this.
- [ ] See if it works on Netlify :-)
